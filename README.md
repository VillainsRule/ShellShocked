    - We use an advanced 'modes' selector where you can choose between 4 different modes:
        - Right Mouse Only: lock on players when the right mouse is held down.
        - Trackpad: a new concept thought of by me for the trackpad users. right click once to start locking. right click again to stop. repeat.
        - Always On: always lock, no way to disable during a round.
        - Off: never on, no way to enable during a round.
- ESP
    - ESP: Egg skins & guns through walls<br><img width="600" src="https://github.com/VillainsRule/ShellShocked/assets/101288516/4c1df94a-3cfe-4ab7-aeeb-7767dc46b7a0">

- Keybinds
    - These allow you to change & control the GUI and the options inside.

<h2 align="center">Why ShellShocked?</h2>

1. It actually gets updates, unlike most other mods.
2. It's fully open source, as well as the first mod to have different files.
3. It has a very clean & simple GUI.
4. It doesn't have 5 minute ads of our own preventing your from booting it (zertalious).

<h2 align="center">Known Bugs</h2>

- Some ESP lines are bugged and render when ESP is off. These lines do not attatch to any players.

<h2 align="center">Usage - Basic</h2>

1. Open the [complied script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VillainsRule/ShellShocked/master/dist/shellshocked.user.js).
    - This is already uploaded to Github so you don't need to compile it yourself!
2. Download/install a userscript manager (like Tampermonkey).
3. Open a new script.
4. Copy the compiled script from step 1 into the new script.
5. Use CTRL+S to save it.
6. Reload Shell Shockers and enjoy!

<h2 align="center">Usage - Advanced</h2>

This will walk you through compiling the script for yourself.<br>
This part is intended for developers, so the instructions are less obvious.<br>
<br>
1. Install NodeJS & Git.
2. Clone the repo & change the directory: `git clone https://github.com/VillainsRule/ShellShocked.git && cd ShellShocked`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build the app: `npm run build`
5. When the build is complete, the script is copied to your clipboard.
    - If this doesn't work, it can be found in your local `dist/shellshocked.user.js`.
6. Paste it into a userscript manager and enjoy!
